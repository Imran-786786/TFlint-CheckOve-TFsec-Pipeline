**Terraform Pipeline**

This README file provides an overview of the Terraform pipeline defined in this repository.

**Pipeline Structure**

* **Parameters:**
    * `environment`: Defines the target environment (e.g., 'dev', 'prod'). Defaults to 'dev'.
* **Variables:**
    * `WORK_DIR`: Dynamically sets the working directory based on the selected `environment`.
* **Stages:**
    * **LintingScanningStage:** 
        * **LintingScanningJob:** 
            * **tfsec:** Performs security and compliance checks on Terraform configurations.
            * **Checkov:** Analyzes Terraform code for security best practices and misconfigurations.
            * **Tflint:** Checks Terraform code for style, best practices, and potential errors.

**Usage**

1. **Configure Environment:**
    - Update the `environment` parameter in the pipeline definition to specify the target environment.
2. **Run Pipeline:**
    - Trigger the pipeline manually or configure it to run automatically (e.g., on code commits).

**Pipeline Output**

* **Test Results:** JUnit XML files containing the results of the linting and scanning tools are published to the pipeline run. This allows for easy integration with test reporting dashboards.

**Terraform Environment and Modules**

* **Structure:**
    * The `environment` directory contains environment-specific configurations (e.g., AWS credentials, region).
    * The `terraform-modules` directory houses reusable Terraform modules for common infrastructure components.

**Best Practices**

* Keep the pipeline definition concise and well-documented.
* Use meaningful task and job names.
* Leverage variables to improve code maintainability and reusability.
* Consider implementing automated remediation for identified issues.
* Regularly review and update the pipeline to incorporate new tools and best practices.

**Note:**

This README provides a basic overview. You may need to adapt it further based on your specific requirements and project structure.
